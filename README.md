# Philippides Client
SPA application built in React.js and TypeScript. Namesake owed the historical figure who inspired the Marathon sporting event, as he raced to deliver news of the Greek victory at Marathon.

### Installation
```
clone or fork repo
npm install
npm run start

optional:
install Prettier extension for automatic formatting.
install Better Comments extension to view the comments in a better format.
```

### Testing
Jest is used for all the test suites.
```
npm run test
```

### Linting & Type safety
All formatting is handled by Prettier. Additionally, (almost) all the strict TS rules are enabled in order to leverage the full might of TypeScript.

### Assumptions

**Redux vs. useContext + useReducer**

**Styling**

Styling is entirely done with SASS as well as leveraging certain components from Ant Design.
Additionally, all design is approached from a mobile-first perspective.
